This repo builds a utility container that is usable with the attached script
to attach to existing running containers for `robo build`, `drupal` console
commands and other manipulations.

See https://github.com/universityofadelaide/docker_drupal8 for a Drupal8
'starter' that uses this and the other docker repositories.

To build manually.

docker build -t uofa/docker_drupal_utility .
